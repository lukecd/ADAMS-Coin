# ADAMSCoin / ADAMSExchange / 42!

### 
This is the repository for the Smart Contracts for ADAMS Exchange. The UI is here https://github.com/lukecd/ADAMS-Exchange

This project started out with me imaginging a token that would appeal to gamblers. I came up with the idea of
taxing every transfer and then giving that tax randomally to a wallet holder. Giving tax rewards away to holders
would incentivize HODLing, and then to make sure whales don't always win, I decided distribute tax
rewards as follows.
    <ol>
        <li>The contract owner can never win.</li>
        <li>10 % of the time, there is a non-weighted distribution. Each wallet has an equal chance of winning, regardless of their token balance.</li>
        <li>90% of the time there is a weighted distribution. Each token owned increases your chance of winning.</li>
    </ol>
Lots more details on how that's handled in the ADAMS Coin Repository.
