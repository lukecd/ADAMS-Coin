    *   This is approximately equal to 5.0% per year compounded every 
    *   second (to 8 decimal places, if max precision is essential, 
    *   calculate nominal interest per year compounded every second from 
    *   your desired effective annual rate). Effective Rate Per Second = 
    *   Nominal Rate Per Second compounded every second = Nominal Rate 
    *   Per Year compounded every second * conversion factor from years 
    *   to seconds
    *   Effective Rate Per Second = 0.05 / (365 days/yr * 86400 sec/day) = 1.5854895991882 * 10 ** -9

    *   1 * 10 ** 27 + Effective Rate Per Second * 10 ** 27
    *   = 1000000001585489599188229325
    *   This will return 5.1271096334354555 Dai on a 100 Dai principal 
    *   over the course of one year (31536000 seconds)
    * @param _age The time period over which to accrue interest. Accepted
    *   in seconds.
    * @return The new principal as a wad. Equal to original principal + 
    *   interest accrued
